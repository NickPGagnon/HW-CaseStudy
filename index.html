        <p class="cardP leftP"> Me and my project partner dilligently went through the design thinking process step by step. We collected a variety of data ranging from surveys and interviews to direct feedback. All of our research was centered around decisivity of people in groups or by themselves as our goal was to eliminate the previously mentioned wasted time and creating a better time-out alone or together.</p>

        <p class=" cardP rightP"> From our research we went out and created a number of deliverables to establish our solution; we invisioned our app to help people out and about decide where to go next by either picking a random (or filtered) location to goto and alternatively include a feature that would choose 1 person from a group to make the decisions for them</p>

        <p class="cardP fullP"> We later went on to fully realize our app design in wireframes and hand sketches to help us with later testing. Flaws and inconsistencies were pointed out to us that we were able to go back and re-iterate on to perfect our design before a higher fidelity version was produced.

    <p class="cardP designP">
        Utilizing the re-iterations our Hi-Fi prototype was completed, the apps specific style was decided and Hi-Fi testing was done as well rounding out the case study. Hypothetically what would be next for our app is building more on requested features as well as actually start the development to make the design a reality for further testing of all sorts.
